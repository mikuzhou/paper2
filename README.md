# LLM Code Modification capacity Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing and modifying code. It provides an in-depth analysis in three key areas:

1. **Time Complexity Optimization**: Assessing LLMs' ability to optimize the time complexity of algorithms.
2. **Space Complexity Optimization**: Evaluating improvements in space complexity by LLMs.
3. **Python to C++ Code Translation**: Analyzing the proficiency of LLMs in translating code from Python to C++.
4. **Analysis Across Varying Difficulty Levels**: The tool can handle code of different complexity levels, providing a comprehensive understanding of LLMs' adaptability and effectiveness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An active OpenAI API key.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.

### Execution
Run the analysis using the main Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
The tool is user-friendly and designed for ease of use. Once set up, it interacts with LLMs to perform the desired analysis on code snippets of varying difficulty levels. The results offer valuable insights into the LLMs' code optimization, translation capabilities, and adaptability to different complexity challenges.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the tool or expand its features. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for any improvements.
